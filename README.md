## Install Instructions

 - Download the [Eyes Aren't Real zip file](https://github.com/mikemaccana/eyes/archive/master.zip) and extract it.
 - You'll need to [register for a rekognition.com starter plan](http://www.rekognition.com/user/create). This gives you, at the time of writing, 5000 free calls a month. By then you should be well and truly bored of this extension.
 - Get a [mashape.com](https://www.mashape.com/orbeus/face-and-scene-recognition-provided-by-rekognition-com) key too.
 - Pop the key, secret and mashape authozation key into `js/eyes.js`
 - Visit [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
 - Click 'Load Unpacked Extension'
 - Select the extracted folder.

Once the extension is installed, you'll need to **restart your browser**.

## Usage

Visit pages with eyes. Notice the eyes have not been removed. See the truth.

When you're bored, disable the extension in [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
